      <h2>About Dominik, The Rust Whisperer üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
      <p>Hey there, I'm Dominik, but you can call me Newt. Why the Rust Whisperer? Because when I code in Rust, the compiler and I are in a harmonious dance. By day, I'm the TCSM (Technical Customer Support Manager) at <a href="https://excelsea.de/" target="_blank">Excelsea GmbH & Co. KG</a>, and by night, I'm an Application Developer at <a href="https://lchcloud.de/" target="_blank">LCH Cloud GmbH</a>.</p>
      <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: I once convinced a Rust compiler to give me a loan. True story!</p>

      <h2>Meet Newt, My Fursona üê∫</h2>
      <p>Newt is a playful, adorable wolf who loves coding and pizza just as much as I do. While I'm out there socializing in the tech world, Newt prefers to keep things low-key. Yes, he's a bit introverted, but don't let that fool you; he can debug a program faster than you can say 'syntax error'!</p>
      <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: Newt has a PhD in 'Pawgramming'!</p>

      <h2>Why Dominik is Cooler Than Your Average Coder üòé</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I speak Rust as fluently as Shakespeare spoke English.</li>
        <li>I'm diving deep into Docker and currently learning Sveltekit, but I can also throw down some TypeScript when needed.</li>
        <li>DevOps and System Integration? Count me in!</li>
        <li>I'm the Lead Developer behind <a href="https://guesstherank.org/" target="_blank">GuessTheRank</a>. You might guess the rank, but you'll never guess how I pulled it off!</li>
        <li>Fun Fact: I'm a Furry! ü¶ä And yes, my fursona Newt can code better than you. Don't believe me? Challenge accepted!</li>
        <li>Side Interests: I also dabble in SEO, UX, and Marketing. Jack of all trades, master of Rust!</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: I once debugged a program by just staring at it. The code got scared and fixed itself.</p>
